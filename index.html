            <p><strong><em>What would happen if everyone on earth stood as close to each other as they<br>could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>—Thomas Bennett (and many others)</em></strong></p>

            <p>This is one of the most popular questions submitted to this blog. It’s been examined before, including by<br>a <a href="#"><strong>ScienceBlogs</strong></a> post and a <a href=""><strong>Straight Dope</strong></a> article. They cover the kinematics pretty well. However,<br>they don’t tell the whole story.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>

            <p>At the start of the scenario, the entire Earth’s population has been magically transported together into<br>one place.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Earth's population'">

            <p>This crowd takes up an area the size of Rhode Island. But there’s no reason to use the vague phrase “an<br>area the size of Rhode Island”. This is our scenario; we can be specific. They’re <em>actually</em> in Rhode Island.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Crowd">
            
            <p>At the stroke of noon, everyone jumps.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Everybody jumps">

            <p>As discussed elsewhere, it doesn’t really affect the planet. Earth outweighs us by a factor of over ten<br>trillion. On average, we humans can vertically jump maybe half a meter on a good day. Even if the Earth<br>were rigid and responded instantly, it would be pushed down by less than an atom’s width.</p>
            <p>Next, everyone falls back to the ground.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Everybody falls">

            <p>Technically, this delivers a lot of energy into the Earth, but it’s spread out over a large enough area that<br>it doesn’t do much more than leave footprints in a lot of gardens. A slight pulse of pressure spreads<br>through the North American continental crust and dissipates with little effect. The sound of all those feet<br>hitting the ground creates a loud, drawn-out roar which lasts many seconds.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the air grows quiet.</p>
            <p>Seconds pass. Everyone looks around.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Everybody looks around">
            <p>There are a lot of uncomfortable glances. Someone coughs.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Someone coughs">

            <p>A cell phone comes out of a pocket. Within seconds, the rest of the world’s five billion phones follow. All<br>of them—even those compatible with the region’s towers—are displaying some version of “NO SIGNAL”.<br>The cell networks have all collapsed under the unprecedented load.</p>
            <p>Outside Rhode Island, abandoned machinery begins grinding to a halt.</p>
            <p>The T. F. Green airport in Warwick, Rhode Island handles a few thousand passengers a day. Assuming<br>they got things organized (including sending out scouting missions to retrieve fuel), they could run at<br>500% capacity for years without making a dent in the crowd.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Dent in a crowd">

            <p>The addition of all the nearby airports doesn’t change the equation much. Nor does the region’s light rail<br>system. Crowds climb on board container ships in the deepwater port of Providence, but stocking<br>sufficient food and water for a long sea voyage proves a challenge.</p>
            <p>Rhode Island’s half-million cars are commandeered. Moments later, I-95, I-195, and I-295 become the<br>sites of the largest traffic jam in the history of the planet. Most of the cars are engulfed by the crowds,<br>but a lucky few get out and begin wandering the abandoned road network.</p>
            <p>Some make it past New York or Boston before running out of fuel. Since the electricity is probably not<br>on at this point, rather than find a working gas pump, it’s easier to just abandon the car and steal the<br>new one. Who can stop you? All the cops are in Rhode Island.</p>
            <p>The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people<br>who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state<br>becomes a patchwork chaos of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common.<br>Everybody is hungry and thirsty. Grocery stores are emptied. Fresh water is hard to come by and there’s<br>no efficient system for distributing it.</p>
            <p>Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.</p>
            <p>The survivors spread out across the face of the world and struggle to build a new civilization atop the<br>pristine ruins of the old. Our species staggers on, but our population has been greatly reduced. Earth’s<br>orbit is completely unaffected—it spins along exactly as it did before our species-wide jump.</p>
            <p>But at least now we know.</p>
